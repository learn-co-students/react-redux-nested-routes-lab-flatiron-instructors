# Nested Routes Lab

## Objectives

1. Build out a nested resource.
2. Implement a redirect using React router.

## Instructions

Congratulations, you're working at Petfinder! Before we get to browse all of the cute puppies and kittens, let's build them a react app with a couple of routes.

You're coworkers have already built out a `PetsPage` component to render out a list of all the Pets. Your assignment is as follows.

1. Create a Route so that visiting `/pets` displays the PetsPage component and renders the list of pets.
2. Visiting '/pets/:id' should display some detailed information about a particular pet.
3. Visiting '/pets/new' should display a form to create a new Pet. After create, the user should be redirected back to '/pets'.
